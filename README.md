# Stock Exchange Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing stock exchange data to uncover market trends, evaluate performance metrics, and provide actionable insights for investors, traders, and financial analysts. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling to better understand stock market behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset includes historical and processed stock exchange data with the following components:
- **Index Data**: Historical prices, volume, opening, closing, high, and low prices for various indices.
- **Index Information**: Metadata about indices, including index name, region, and category.
- **Processed Data**: Aggregated or cleaned data used for advanced analysis and modeling.

### Data Source
[Specify where the dataset is sourced from, e.g., Yahoo Finance, Kaggle, or custom collected data.]

### Files Included
1. `indexData.csv`: Raw historical data of stock indices.
2. `indexInfo.csv`: Details and attributes of the stock indices.
3. `indexProcessed.csv`: Cleaned and transformed data for analysis.

## Objectives
1. **Explore Market Trends**: Analyze trends across various indices over time.
2. **Evaluate Index Performance**: Compare performance across different regions and sectors.
3. **Predictive Analysis**: Develop models to forecast stock prices or index performance.
4. **Visual Insights**: Create dashboards and visualizations to make insights accessible to stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Processing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Modeling**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, ARIMA (for time series forecasting)

## Features
- Time series analysis of index performance
- Regional comparison of indices
- Predictive modeling for stock market trends
- Interactive dashboards to visualize findings

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
